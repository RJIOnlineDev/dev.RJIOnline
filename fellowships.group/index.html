			  <p>The Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute invites proposals from people and institutions to collaborate with RJI on ideas and projects that will help us understand and meet the information needs of individuals in their roles as citizens.</p>

			  <p>Some areas of particular interest include:</p>

			  <ul>
				<li>Projects focused on inclusivity and engaging communities.</li>
				<li>Applied research that helps us better understand the business and practice of journalism.</li>
				<li>New techniques, tools and technologies.</li> 
				<li>Prototypes that need further development and market testing.</li>
				<li>Ideas for new revenue streams or business models that many news organizations could adopt.</li>
			  </ul>

			  <p>We have three formats for RJI Fellowships:<a href="{path='fellowships/matrix'}"><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="/images/posts/fellowsmatrix2015.png" style="width: 400px; height: 328px; margin: 10px; float: right;" /></a></p>

			  <h3 id="residential">1. RJI Residential Fellow</h3>

			  <p>Designed for persons inside and outside media industries who want to collaborate with RJI in the pursuit of solutions to a particular journalism problem. Residential fellows spend eight months on campus at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, taking advantage of the intellectual and technological resources of RJI and the school and interacting with Missouri faculty and students. Some examples include: access to programmers and app developers, financial support to conduct market research and hiring students to produce multi-media content.</p>

			  <p>Solutions, in the form of strategies, products or services, developed from these ideas would be shared with many news and news-related organizations. You must reside in Columbia for the duration of this fellowship.</p>

			  <h3 id="non-residential">2. RJI Non-residential Fellow</h3>
			  Designed for entrepreneurial individuals with a strong interest in journalism and issues related to digital communications. Your fellowship can be about something you are interested in pursuing on your own or something that could benefit a current employer. Successful ideas, products or strategies should serve as a model for the news industry or help the industry get smarter, faster, nimbler. You do not need to live in Columbia, Missouri, but will need to make occasional visits to consult with RJI leadership and staff.

			  <h3 id="institutional">3. RJI Institutional Fellows</h3>
			  Designed to unlock some of the thoughtful, meaningful ideas inside newsrooms, ad departments, boardrooms, break rooms, etc., that for various reasons can&rsquo;t get any traction. RJI will collaborate with a leader at a company or institution who will identify an employee who can develop an idea or lead a team that could do it. The employee will be named an RJI Fellow but will continue working at his or her job. The stipend for this fellowship will be paid to the company or institution to be used for salary relief for the fellow, or for another purpose that the company or institution determines will best ensure the success of the fellowship project.
