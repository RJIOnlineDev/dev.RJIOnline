			  <p>The Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute invites proposals from people and institutions to collaborate with us on innovative ideas and projects to improve the practice or understanding of journalism. We’re giving special consideration this year to ideas and projects focused on solving problems created by filter bubbles, fake news and mistrust of the news media; however, we also invite submission of other ideas and projects that could strengthen democracy through better journalism.</p>

			  <p>Successful collaborations are often in one of three categories but are not limited to the following:</p>

			  <ul>
				<li>Transformation of an idea into a market-tested prototype.</li>
				<li>Development and deployment of a prototyped product or service into a substantial market test to prepare it for angel or venture investment or a full product launch.</li>
				<li>Scholarly research that leads to publication of new understandings about the practice of journalism.</li>
			  </ul>

			  <p>We have three formats for RJI Fellowships:<a href="{path='fellowships/matrix'}"><img alt="" class="img-responsive" src="/images/posts/fellowsmatrix2015.png" style="width: 400px; height: 328px; margin: 10px; float: right;" /></a></p>

			  <h3 id="residential">1. Residential</h3>

			  <p>Residential fellowships are designed for persons, inside and outside media industries, who want to collaborate with RJI in the pursuit of solutions to a particular journalism problem. Residential fellows spend eight months on campus at the Missouri School of Journalism, taking advantage of the intellectual and technological resources of RJI and the school and interacting with Missouri faculty and students. Resource examples include access to programmers and app developers, financial support to conduct market research, and paid students to produce multimedia content.</p>

			  <p>Solutions — in the form of strategies, products or services — developed from these ideas would be shared with many news and news-related organizations. You must reside in Columbia, Missouri, for the duration of this fellowship.</p>

			  <h3 id="non-residential">2. Nonresidential</h3>

			  <p>Nonresidential fellowships are designed for entrepreneurial individuals with a strong interest in journalism and issues related to digital communications. Your fellowship can be about something you are interested in pursuing on your own or something that could benefit a current employer. Successful ideas, products or strategies should serve as a model for the news industry or help the industry get smarter, faster and nimbler. You do not need to live in Columbia but you will need to make occasional visits to consult with RJI leadership and staff.</p>

			  <h3 id="institutional">3. Institutional</h3>

			  <p>Institutional fellowships are designed to unlock some of the thoughtful, meaningful ideas inside newsrooms, ad departments, boardrooms and break rooms that for various reasons can’t get any traction. RJI will collaborate with a leader at a company or institution who will identify an employee who can develop an idea or lead a team that could do it. The employee will be named an RJI Fellow but will continue working at his or her job. The stipend for this fellowship will be paid to the company or institution to be used for salary relief for the part-time fellow, or for another purpose that the company or institution determines will best ensure the success of the fellowship project.</p>

			  <p>We will ask you to describe the collaboration project you’re proposing. Once you answer all questions, click Apply. We will acknowledge the receipt of your application.</p>

			  <p>For proposals we advance to the next stage of consideration, we will ask you to answer a second, more detailed set of questions about the project, its deliverables, your qualifications to collaborate with us, what your team will contribute to that collaboration and what you may need from RJI in the collaboration. After that, we may interview some of those who submit second-stage applications.</p>

			  <p>We plan to make our selection of fellows in the early spring. The materials you submit in this application process become the property of RJI to use as part of our mission to advance the practice of journalism. We will notify you at the e-mail address you supply of our final decision regarding your application.</p>

			  <p>If you have questions about this process, contact <a href="https://www.rjionline.org/account/profile/593">Roger Gafke</a> RJI’s selection committee chairman, at <a href="mailto:rjifellows2017@rjionline.org">rjifellows2017@rjionline.org</a>.</p>
