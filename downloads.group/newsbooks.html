				<p class="lead">RJI Digital Newsbooks are visually rich e-books designed to make investigative and long-form journalism easier to access and read on tablets, e-readers and other mobile devices.</p>
				<p>Since January 2007, Roger Fidler, RJI’s program director for digital publishing, and his graduate student assistants from the Missouri School of Journalism have designed and produced more than 40 Digital Newsbooks at no cost to members of the RJI Digital Publishing Alliance.</p>
				<p>While most members use newsbooks to build audience loyalty or to attract donations, some are selling their RJI Digital Newsbooks or similar e-books they have created in-house through online bookstores.</p>
				<p>In 2009, the RJI briefly hosted a pilot online store where Digital Newsbooks could be purchased and downloaded. While only a few hundred newsbooks were sold, the field test demonstrated the potential of e-book versions of investigative reports to generate revenue for news organizations even when the content could be freely accessed on their websites.</p>
				<p>The news organizations that have participated in this project include The New York Times, Washington Post, Center for Public Integrity, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, St. Petersburg Times, Commercial Appeal and Investigative Reporters and Editors.</p>
				<p>Fidler began developing the Digital Newsbook concept in 2001, while he was a professor of journalism and information design at Kent State University in Ohio.</p>
				<p>The Los Angeles Times commissioned Fidler to produce the first Digital Newsbooks — in English and Spanish — for a six-part series titled “Enrique’s Journey.” They debuted at the first Tablet PC Conference, sponsored by Microsoft, Adobe and the Open eBook Forum, in New York City on Dec. 5, 2002. The series earned Pulitzer Prizes for the reporter and photographer in the following year.</p>
				<p>Between 2002 and 2004, Fidler produced several more Digital Newsbooks for the Los Angeles Times as well as for the Rocky Mountain News and Denver Post. All were made available to download from the newspapers’ websites.</p>
				<p>In 2004, Fidler was named as the first Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute Fellow and relocated to Columbia. During his fellowship year, he worked with the Columbia Missourian and Missouri School of Journalism to field test a tablet newspaper model that built on a concept he had pursued at Knight-Ridder Inc. and Kent State University. He called the model “Electronic Media Print (eMprint)”.</p>
				<p>Soon after founding the RJI Digital Publishing Alliance in January 2007, he began producing a new version of his Digital Newsbook model for DPA members.</p>

				<p>The Digital Newsbooks in this catalog are free to download unless otherwise noted. The cover images are hyperlinked directly to the newsbooks or to the participating news organization's Web pages where the newsbooks can be accessed. They can be opened and comfortably read within any PDF viewer; however, they are best read within PDF viewers that support hyperlinks. For Apple iPad owners we recommend the iBooks or Goodreader app.</p>
